### Translations ###

If you want to use your own set of labels/names/descriptions and so on you can do so. 
All text output in this plugin is controlled via the gettext methods.

Please use your preferred way to make your own translations from the /wp-content/plugins/pdc-faq/languages/pdc-faq.pot file

Be careful not to put the translation files in a location which can be overwritten by a subsequent update of the plugin, theme or WordPress core.

We recommend using the 'Loco Translate' plugin. 
https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/

This plugin provides an easy interface for custom translations and a way to store these files without them getting overwritten by updates.

For instructions how to use the 'Loco Translate' plugin, we advice you to read the Beginners's guide page on their website: https://localise.biz/wordpress/plugin/beginners
or start at the homepage: https://localise.biz/wordpress/plugin
